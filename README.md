# Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio

Hi, I'm Nicolas Vollmer! I have a unique combination of technical proficiency and business acumen, which allows me to effectively analyze data, communicate insights,and drive results. In my recent private data analytics projects I showcase below, I have demonstrated my ability to gather, process, and analyze large amounts of data, as well as my expertise in various data visualization and reporting tools such as Python, MS Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and Excel.

I am driven to continuously enhance my knowledge and improve my skills in the field of Data Analytics and Business Intelligence. As a result, I am actively seeking new opportunities in these areas and am open to full-time work in and around DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. My commitment to personal and professional growth, combined with my strong technical abilities, make me a valuable asset to any organization. Let's connect and see how I can bring value to your team.

## My Project Showcase

[**1. Adventure Works Cycles Power BI Dashboard**](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/b507b2ef-6dd4-436c-8a7e-3b8c427cf190/ReportSection?ctid=59c174aa-68bf-4830-8882-230964810300&clientSideAuth=0)

Here's a link to my interactive Microsoft Power BI Dashboard, created as part of a Udemy course. To view my work, you will need access to Power BI.

In this project, I was tasked with creating an end-to-end BI solution for Adventure Works Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company with global operations. The goal was to allow the client to track key business KPIs such as sales, revenues, profits, and returns at the product level and across sales territories.

Starting from a folder of raw data in CSV format, I used Power BI Desktop to connect and transform the data into a relational data model. I then created calculated columns and DAX measures to blend information and designed an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize the data. The result is a comprehensive solution that provides valuable insights into the business performance of Adventure Works Cycles.

[**2. Etsy Flower Girl Market Analysis**](https://github.com/NicolasVollmer/Etsy-Flower-Girl-Market-Analysis)

I recently conducted a market analysis for a friend who runs a side-business on Etsy selling [flower girl dresses](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=flower+girl+dress&explicit=1&order=highest_reviews&page=1&ref=pagination "flower girl dresses") for formal occasions like weddings and baptisms. The platform is not transparent to sellers about their individual market segment, so I built a scraping tool to gather information such as prices, sizing options, reviews, number of sales, and more from individual listings in the flower girl category. The goal was to provide insights and recommendations to help my friend's business succeed on the Etsy platform.

_Questions I sought to answer with my research:_

* How does our client rank compared to the competition on Etsy?
* What can be done to increase traffic to her shop?
	* I am currently working on implementing NLP to analyze listing names for potential search engine optimization (SEO) keywords, and as a stretch goal, I plan to perform a palette analysis of the listing images and a subject matter analysis to see if the absence of models in her listings negatively impacted her sales.
* How can we drive up sales conversion and improve the shop's rank?
	* I aimed to examine the impact of pricing level on overall sales and if implementing an open returns policy could drive conversion.

[**3. A Gastro-Scene Showdown!**](https://github.com/NicolasVollmer/My_Ironhack_Mid-Bootcamp_Project)

My wife and I love eating out together! Especially when travelling, we go through a lenghty process of finding the best restaurants for a good time. For this reason, I compared the restaurants from 10 European cities to find which destination generally has the best restaurants overall, and which restaurants are the go-to recommendations for each city! For data, I scraped reviews of restaurant businesses in these select cities from Google Maps.

_Questions I sought to answer with my research:_

* Which competing city will win the title 'Gourmet Capital of Europe'?
* What is the probability of having a positive dining experience by randomly selecting any restaurant in our contestant cities?
* Which restaurants are the best in each city?
* City Restaurant Heatmaps - Where am I most likely to find a good restaurant? Are there any clusters?
* "Ceap&Cheerful-Meter" (TM) - Which restaurants offer a good bang for your buck?


## About Me
Data analytics has been a part of my career for many years! In the past I worked extensively on rate, occupancy and competitive analyses in the hospitality industry. I further look back on several successful years working on time-sensitive project cases for key consulting clients whilst with Guidepoint.
