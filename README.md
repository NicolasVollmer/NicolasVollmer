## My Highlighed Projects


## About Me
Data analytics has been a part of my career for many years! In the past I worked extensively on rate, occupancy and competitive analyses in the hospitality industry. I further look back on several successful years working on time-sensitive project cases for key consulting clients whilst with Guidepoint. For several years I have also trained colleagues on matters such as professional stakeholder communication and operative toolsets. Thanks to my many years of studying and working abroad, I bring along excellent communication skills in English, which has virtually become my second native language alongside German.
